Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is BÃ¡rbara, I'm a Front-end developer working with global brands at Wunderman Thompson Technology, using mainly HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. I'm a former Environmental Engineer that decided to learn some coding and ended up going on a career transition into web development.

I started my new career as a customer service agent at startup EuNenem, and after a few months of studying web development through Free Code Camp, I started working as a Trainee Front-end Developer at EuNenem, while I kept studying.

After a year at EuNenem, I took part in a mentorship program for women on career transitions, promoted by Wunderman Thompson Technology. I learned a lot about how to develop my previous skills focusing on my new career. As a result, I was hired as a CMS author by Wunderman Thompson Technology, moving to the front-end team six months later. I've been working with clients from Canada and Brazil since then, while I also had the chance to take my studies even further with the help of mentors from my team.

Concurrently with my current position at Wunderman Thompson Technology, I'm also stuyding TypeScript and back-end by developing some personal projects.

It's been a tough journey so far, but I love what I do and I'm thrilled about my future in tech :)
